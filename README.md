A weather dashboard that allows the user to search for the current and five day forecast of their searched city. Utilizes OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities and incorporates localStorage to store data.

I Used the https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys to retrieve weather data for cities. I used local storage to save persistent data.
